    <h1>Welcome to My List of Favorite Restaurants in Indy</h1>
    <p>This list contains my 5 favorite restaurants:</p>

<a href="https://www.bonefishgrill.com/" target="_blank">Bonefish Grill</a>
<p>When it comes to eating out in Indy, my absolute favorite place is Bonefish Grill.  They have an outrageous appetizer in the &copy;Bang-Bang Shrimp.  Their bread and pesto is also out of this world.  Choose any fresh fish for the entree and you will have an incredible dining experience for a reasonable price</p>

<a href="https://www.thecheesecakefactory.com/" target="_blank">Cheesecake Factory</a>
<p>Another solid choice in the Indianpolis area is the Cheesecake Factory.  They provide you with very generous portions, including my personal favorite Chicken and Biscuit.  And you simply cannot leave their facility without ordering some cheesecake to eat during your visit or to take home if you've ran out of room.  The price is reasonable, and you could absolutely share an entree and dessert with a friend given the portion sizes.</p>

<a href="https://www.stelmos.com/" target="_blank"> St Elmos</a>
<p>Perhaps the single most famous restaurant in Indianpolis is the St Elmo's, known for their juicy steaks and very spicy shrimp cocktail.  Everything here is a la carte, and the cost will add up quickly.  Certainly worth it for a treat, especially if you want a thick and juicy ribeye or filet mignon.</p>

<a href="https://www.zomato.com/indianapolis/a1-japanese-steak-house-sushi-mooresville" target="_blank">A1 Japanese Steakhouse and Sushi</a>
<p>A1 Japanese Steakhoue is a bit off the map for visitors and residents of Indianapolis.  Located southwest of Indianapolis in Mooresville, this Japanese steakhouse has delicious hot hibachi choices such as teriyaki chicken, shrimp and steak, but their real treasure is found in their sushi.  Prices are pretty reasonable compared to similar sushi restaurants, but the presentation and taste are second to none.</p>
